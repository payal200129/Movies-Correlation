# Movies-Correlation
- To determine which factor contributes the most towards the success of a movie.
- This project was done with the help of python libraries like pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.The main algorithm used in the process was correlation(spearman) between different factors.
- In order to visualize the data in an attractive way and to draw meaningful inferences I drew a heatmap highlighting different shades corresponding to the degree of correlation. Various Features like name, rating, genre, year released, score, votes, director and writer were considered. The factor with highest value which was budget turned out to be the desired result.
